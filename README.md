# eBookPerfChecklist
A progressive web app to help you boost eBook performance

## Details

This tool will be released ASAP, its current status is “refacto” because `inputs` can be tough (especially when providing users with details for each label).

Please note it’s an [implementation of this medium article](https://medium.com/@jiminypan/lets-talk-about-ebook-performance-801b83745ea4#.5qjgs8i2i). 

It is part of the Blitz Project.

Currently v.0.22 (buggy bungalow) and available [on this page](https://friendsofepub.github.io/eBookPerfChecklist/).
