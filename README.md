# eBookPerfChecklist
A progressive web app to help you boost eBook performance

## Details

This tool will be released ASAP, its current status is “refacto” because `inputs` can be tough (especially when providing users with details for each label).

Please note a [functionnal prototype exists](https://twitter.com/JiminyPan/status/778887612681621504). 

It is part of the Blitz Project.
